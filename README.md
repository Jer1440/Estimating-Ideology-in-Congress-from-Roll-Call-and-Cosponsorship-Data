# Estimating-Ideology-in-Congress-from-Roll-Call-and-Cosponsorship-Data
R and WinBUGS Code and file for the estimation of the ideal points/ideology of members of Congress using observed roll call votes and cosponsorship data.  This code was used in my book, The Path to Gay Rights (2018, NYU Press) to estimate changes in Congressional support for gay rights by party from the late 1980s to early 2000s.  Note: Most of this code was written before dplyr and other data management packages in R were in common use.
