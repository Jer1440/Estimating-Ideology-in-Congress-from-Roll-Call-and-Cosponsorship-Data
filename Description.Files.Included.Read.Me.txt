	Ideological Ideal Point Model Estimation Model.  This model is described in more 
	detail in the Appendix 1 of Garretson 2018.  The results of an analysis of roll call
	votes and gays rights are displayed on page 118.

1. Folder 'Raw Data on Roll Calls and Cosponsorship' contains roll call vote data for the 93rd to
	109th congresses. Roll Call data from Keith Poole and Howard Rosenthal's website 
	voteview.com.  Cosponsorship data from James Fowler's (UCSD) website.

2. 'WinBugsModelAnotedCode.txt' Contains the basic WinBUGS code for the model with notes describing in Appendix 1.

3. 'functionMakeVotesBillsBugsFile.txt' contains code for 2 R functions that simplify the extraction
	of small subsets of votes from the Poole and Fowler data.  
	(Note: These functions were written before dplyr and other data management packages in R
		were in common use.)

	1. 'makebillsandvotesfileH() takes in three arguments (1: a vector of Poole/Rosenthal Bill numbers,
		2: a vector of names of bills in a string formate ("HR100"), and 3: a congress number)
		and creates a WinBUGS Data File "data.txt' of the rollcall and cosponsorship information 
		of those bills in the current working directory for use in WinBugs.  The data is also 
		saved as an object in R for use in the below function.  This can then be copy and pasted or 
		opened in WinBugs.

	2. 'votesbilldatamerge' takes in two outputs data objects from the prior function, and merges them into
		a single file, while outputing a corresponding 'data.txt' file for WinBugs.  That way, votes and
		bill can be combined for WinBugs across multiple congresses.

4. 'gaybillsandvotesrawdata.txt' contains the vectors of roll call votes and bills that involved gay rights 
	from the 100th to 109th congress used in the book.  

5. 'winbugsgayvotes100102' and similarly named files contains the actual WinBUGS files used in estimate in the book
	with the years of the cross-sectional estimation at the end of the file name.

6. 'gaybillresults.txt' contains a data file of the descriptions of each legislator's ideal points on gay rights
	in the 4 times periods used.  The prefixes correspond to the time period:
	'x100' ~ 100-102nd Congress
	'x103' ~ 103-104th Congress
	'x105' ~ 105-106th Congress
	'x1'   ~ 107-109th Congress
	The file is space deliminated with strings in quotes.
	Most of the variables names are intuitive and correspond to data in the Pool/Rosenthal data sets or standard 
	WinBugs MCMC outputs.  For instance 'x1mean' in the mean of the ideal point for each member in the 
	100-102nd Congress, and 'x12.5' is the 2.5% quantile in the 100-102nd congress.
